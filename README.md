<h1>Project Description</h1>

In this project, I used the OpenCV library and Haar Cascade XML files to create a very basic face and eye detection program. I created a function where one will provide the image path as the argument. Then, the function will load the image from the given path and then detect the objects (face and eyes) with the help of cascade classifiers. Next, it draws a rectangle on each of those objects. At last, it prints the number of faces and pair of eyes detected and also displays the image.

<h1>OpenCV</h1>

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Image Processing. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

<h1>Haar Cascade Classifier</h1>

Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach whereas Haar Cascade is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.

<h1>Face Detection</h1>
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.
