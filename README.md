<h1>Project Description</h1>

In this project, I used the OpenCV library and Haar Cascade Classifiers to create a very basic face and eye detection program.

<h1>Computer Vision</h1>

Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images , videos and other visual inputs.

<h1>OpenCV</h1>

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Image Processing. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

<h1>Haar Cascade Classifier</h1>

Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach. Haar Cascade is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.
