<h1>Project Description</h1>

In this project, I used the OpenCV library and Haar Cascade XML files to create a very basic face and eye detection program. This program will give the number of faces and pair of eyes detected along with the image where the faces and eyes are detected.

<h1>OpenCV</h1>

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Image Processing. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

<h1>Haar Cascade Classifier</h1>

Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach whereas Haar Cascade is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.

<h1>Face Detection</h1>
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.
